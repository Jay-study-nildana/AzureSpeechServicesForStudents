# Class Library That actually consumes the API

This is the class library that is consumed by the driver program and the API.

You only need this class library in your own project for all intentions and purposes.

# Notes

1. Look inside the file, SpeechConfiguration.cs. This is where you put the essential details. Update the default constructor with the following values. Dont worry about the key below. They have been deleted from my account. change region, langauge and voice type as you need.
   ```
   SpeechKey = "379e2c41eaf0408b8fa8dfef1d22cbf6";
   SpeechRegion = "eastus";
   SpeechSynthesisLanguage = "en-IN";
   SpeechSynthesisVoiceName = "en-IN-NeerjaNeural";
   ```
1. Place holder items.
