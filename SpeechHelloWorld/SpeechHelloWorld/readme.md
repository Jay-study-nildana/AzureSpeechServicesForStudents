# Main Driver Program

This is the main driver program. Essentially a console app that can be used to test things.

I suppose it might be simpler to use a Unit Test project but this seems more simpler.

# Note About ImageToTextAndSuch Project for Image Analysis.

I have included a folder called testimages. It contains some nude and racy images I got from wikipedia and unsplash.

You need to place this follder, in the bin folder to run the driver program and get results. You can also add your new images for testing.
